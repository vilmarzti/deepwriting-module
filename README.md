# Deepwriting Module
In this project I try to recreate and improve the results from the [Deepwriting](https://ait.ethz.ch/projects/2018/deepwriting/) project. 

## Dependecies
### Poetry
I use poetry to take care of my project and install the needed dependencies. Check out [this](https://medium.com/@cjolowicz/hypermodern-python-d44485d9d769) for further information on how to setup a project with poetry

#### Poetry could not install tensorflow 2.1.0
Run this command and everything should be set `poetry run pip install -U pip`
